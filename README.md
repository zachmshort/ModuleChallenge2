# ModuleChallenge2

This was the first of even number module challenge, meaning the entirety of the code was written from scratch. I did reuse the some of code from previous homeworks/classworks, referred to forums (W3Schools) for help, and utilized the tutor network. The screen has been adjusted assuming it will be viewed on a laptop/desktop and phone. I have included screenshots of what it looked like on my screen prior to committing to GitHub, in the event something is altered during that process.
